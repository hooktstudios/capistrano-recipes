## Ruby

### Unicorn Zero-Downtime deployments

Check the provided sample configuration (config-samples/unicorn.rb)

@see http://ariejan.net/2011/09/14/lighting-fast-zero-downtime-deployments-with-git-capistrano-nginx-and-unicorn

## PHP

### PHP-fpm reload

You may need to reload php-fpm if you are using APC or other accelerators because of symlinks caching issues.

Your deployment user will need permission to reload php-fpm. You may edit your /etc/sudoers like so for userx:

    userx ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service php5-fpm reload

### CakePHP recipe

To set database configuration and other environment configurations, we use a symlinked shared config file named bootstrap.local.php.

You may add this to the default CakePHP bootstrap file to include the deployment configs :

    if(file_exists(APP . DS . 'config' . DS . 'bootstrap.local.php')) 
    {
    	include(APP . DS . 'config' . DS . 'bootstrap.local.php');
    }
